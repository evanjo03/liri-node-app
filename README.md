# Liri Node Application
 
## Liri Node Application
This project was an introduction to basic Node.js functionality, including npm and various packages including inquirer, axios, spotify node API, and others.  The goal was for the application to function as a simplified Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI), similar to SIRI.  The user can pass in arguments and the application makes calls to return specific data based on those arguments.
